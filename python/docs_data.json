            "lytics prevents your identity strategy from breakdown through a set of powerful tools focused on ensuring the following profile healthrelated questions have concrete answers",
            "behind each lytics profile is an identity graph this graph represents connections between pieces of data observed across multiple sources or even within a single source",
            "to create or update profiles from a data stream the stream must contain one or moreidentity keysthat identify distinct users with which to associate the data when data is observed for a given identity key it stores the relevant profile metadata in an object called anidentity fragment when theres evidence on a data stream that two keys or fragments should be connected",
            "when evidence on a data stream shows that two keys or fragments identify the same realworld entity those fragments become connected in the same identity graph some identity graphs are significant and represent complex relationships in the data in contrast other identity graphs are small and describe a small interaction like an anonymous cookie from a singlevisit incognito browser",
            "",
            "as you learned from the identity resolution overview a profile comprises one or more identity fragments many profiles start as singletons  new data is observed on a data stream that events identifier keys create any necessary identity fragments and store the events associated data on that fragment",
            "however were not satisfied with several singletons  our objective is to stitch data sources together by linking the appropriate underlying fragments stitching occurs when we observe two identifiers in a single event a common stitching event is a newsletter signup where the email address from the newsletter form is linked to the cookie from their web activity and creates a link between activity from the browser on the device and any activity associated with the email address which could eventually encompass purchases support tickets crm data etc",
            "in graph terms stitching creates an edge between two nodes representing two identity fragments if we wanted to retrieve a profile associated with an email address we would retrieve all of the fragments with edges or connections to other fragments from there wed want to find all of the connections to those other fragments and so on until there are no more connections to follow following one fragment to another is calledtraversal the full set of fragments that are found to have connections to the initial fragment are calledneighbors",
            "in lytics default graph limits cap the number of traversals allowed for an individual profile at 50 and cap the number of neighbors allowed at 50 changing these values can create different sets of user profiles over the same data set and should not be adjusted lightly to change these values for your data please contactlytics support",
            "as we traverse identity graphs well quickly find that identity fragments and their corresponding identity keys are not all created equal an identifiers strength must contribute proportionally to its influence on identity resolution",
            "for example you have email addresses and cookies as identity keys generally a user identified with an email address can have multiple cookie values from different devices browsers periods etc imagine hosting a promotional inperson event and having multiple tablets collecting participants email addresses depending on how those email addresses are collected most likely through an online form youll likely have one cookie associated withmanyemail addresses",
            "",
            "field types for identity keys can be either a string or a string set string sets are a common field type for cookies since one profile is expected to have many cookie values over time email addresses are not so cutanddry some organizations will constrain profiles to have one email address while others will allow profiles to have multiple personal work etc in our example of email collection via physical tablet if the email address is a singlevalued string type we wont end up with an overmerged hairball",
            "using an identity key that allows for a set of values is usually a good idea to have a sensical capacity cap on the field type a set of cookies for example might have a capacity limit of 50 values on the other hand a set of emails might have a capacity limit of 5 values",
            "the ranking of your identity keys should reflect their reliability and their relative importance in the strategy in the event of a conflict in stitching and merging higherranked identity keys will win typically most lytics users configure email identifiers to be ranked higher than cookie identifiers",
            "imagine a scenario where email a is connected to cookies x and y while email b is connected to cookie z if new data is observed that connects email b with cookie y we have aconflict meaning that a resulting stitching between the two fragments would yield a profile with twodifferentemail fragments and violates our merge rules",
            "the ranks of identity keys would dictate that for the new event the email address it contains is of a higher priority than the cookie value that it contains and would consequently update the profile for email a andnotthe profile for email b",
            "we mentioned that a critical tenet of bulletproof identity resolution is that profile complexity remains stable over time that is we need a way to ensure that a relatively greedy algorithm doesnt result in profiles becoming more fragile and susceptible to conflicts",
            "in lytics that is accomplished via graph compaction a process by which data from multiple fragments is combined into a single fragment doing so allows wellestablished relationships in the graph to be solidified while making room for new relationships within the profile it functions more as a type of profile housekeeping to keep profile fragments tidy",
            "compaction in identity graphs can take on a few forms",
            "lets go back to our example with email a and email b the point of identity resolution within a customer data platform is to enable long and rich relationships with customers the longer that email a and email b represent profiles in the platform the more cookies with which theyll eventually become connected each identity keys ranking allows an identity graph to compact by size or time",
