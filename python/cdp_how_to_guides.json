is to walk you through the basic steps of setting up mParticle in your app, unlocking core functionality, and troubleshooting common issues. Along the way, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll cover some important concepts you need to understand to be successful with mParticle.\n\n\nThis is not a complete guide to all of mParticle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s features and capabilities. If you already know your way around mParticle and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking for in-depth docs, head to our \nDevelopers\n or \nGuides\n sections.\n\n\n\nMost of this guide is aimed at users of the mParticle Dashboard, but to follow along with the tutorials, you will need to set up the mParticle SDK in your iOS, Android or web app, so you may need support from a developer to complete some steps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples\n\n\nThe tutorials in this guide follow the process of setting up mParticle in the mPTravel app: a mobile and web app that sells luxury travel packages to its users. \n\n\nLater on in this guide, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll learn about sending data from mParticle to some of our many integration partners. As examples, the tutorials use services which are simple to set up and verify, and which offer a free account tier, so that you will be able follow the examples exactly if you wish. However, mParticle is agnostic about which integrations you choose and you can follow the same basic steps from this guide to implement any of our integrations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInputs and Outputs\n\n\nOne of the key functions of mParticle is to receive your data from wherever it originates, and send it wherever it needs to go. The sources of your data are inputs and the service or app where it is forwarded are outputs. A connection is a combination of an input and output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInputs include:\n\n\n\n\nApps or services built on any platform we support, such as iOS, Android, or Web. You can view the full list in \nSETUP > Inputs\n in the PLATFORMS tab.\n\n\nData feeds of any other data you want to send into mParticle. This could be data you have collected yourself or from a feed partner. Once configured, feed inputs are listed in \nSETUP > Inputs\n on the FEEDS tab.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOutputs may be configured for events, audiences, cookie syncs, or data subject requests depending on what the output supports. You can see the list of configured outputs in \nSETUP > Outputs\n or \nSETUP > Data Warehouses\n. Outputs include: \n\n\nAnalytics partners such as Indicative  \n\n\nAdvertising partners such as Facebook  \n\n\nIn-app messaging partners such as Braze  \n\n\nData Warehouse partners, such as Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery, or Snowflake \n\n\n\n\nTo get started with mParticle, you need some data, which means you need to create at least one input.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate Access Credentials\n\n\nThe first thing you need to do is to to create a set of access credentials that will allow a client-side SDK or a server-side application to forward data to this workspace. \n\n\n\n\nLogin to your mParticle account. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re just getting started, your first workspace is created for you. The first screen you see is an overview of activity in the workspace. Since you haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t yet sent any data, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nothing to report, so far.\n\n\n\nNavigate to \nSetup > Inputs\n in the left column. Here you can see each platform type accepted by mParticle. Different platforms are associated with different sets of metadata, such as device identifiers, and most outputs only accept data from a limited set of platforms, so it is important to select the right platform. To capture data from your native Android app, choose \nAndroid\n. Just click the \n+\n next to your chosen platform.\n\n\n\nClick \nIssue Keys\n.\n\n\n\n\nCopy and save the generated Key and Secret.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Access Credentials\n\n\nmParticle labels the credentials you create for an integration the key and secret, but they are not exactly like an API key and secret, since you embed these credentials in the app. However, this is not the security risk that exposing API credentials would be:\n\n\n\n\nThe client-side key and secret can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t read data from the system.\n\n\nYou can \nblock bad data\n to stop any traffic that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t match the data you expect as defined in your schema.\n\n\n\n\nMost anonymous client-server architectures, including Adobe, Braze, Firebase, Google Analytics, and Segment don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have per-session or per-instance credentials, nor does mParticle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstall and Initialize an mParticle SDK\n\n\nYou need a developer to help you install and initialize an SDK. See the Getting Started guides for the \niOS\n, \nAndroid\n or \nJavascript\n SDKs to get set up before continuing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVerify: Look for Incoming Data in the Live Stream\n\n\n\n\nNavigate to \nActivity > Live Stream\n in the left column. The Live Stream lets you inspect all incoming data from your development environments. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an easy way to check that you have correctly initialized mParticle in your app. When you first open up the Live Stream, it will be empty, as we haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t yet started sending data.\n\n\n\nStart up a development build of your app (get a developer to help you if necessary). The mParticle SDKs automatically collect and forward data about installs and user sessions, so just by opening a development build of your app, you should start to see data in the Live Stream.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced Platform Configuration Settings\n\n\nFor the iOS, Android, tvOS, and Web platforms, some advanced configuration settings are available. To change these settings, navigate to \nSetup > Inputs\n in the left column and select either iOS, Android, tvOS, or Web from the list of platforms. \n\n\nExpand the \nAdvanced Settings\n by clicking the + icon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRestrict Device ID by Limit Ad Tracking\n\n\niOS, Android, and tvOS (Apple TV) devices allow users to limit the collection of advertising IDs. Advertising IDs are unique identifiers you may use to associate event and user data with a specific device. For both iOS and Android devices, if a user has not provided explicit consent to share their device\u00e2\u0080\u0099s advertising ID, then the value of that ID is set to an all-zero value.\n\n\nBy checking \nRestrict Device ID by Limit Ad Tracking\n, mParticle will not collect advertising IDs from users who have enabled the Limit Ad Tracking setting on their device.\n\n\nRemember, mParticle will collect advertising IDs for both iOS and Android devices, regardless of whether or not a user has enabled the Limit Ad Tracking setting on their device. However, the IDs collected from users who have opted out will be all-zero values.\n\n\nFollowing are descriptions of Apple and Google\u00e2\u0080\u0099s policies for device advertising IDs:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\niOS Advertising IDs\n\n\nAfter the release of iOS 14.5, Apple introduced the App Tracking Transparency (ATT) framework, which requires app developers to request users\u00e2\u0080\u0099 explicit consent to share their advertising IDs. If a user of your app has not provided this consent, Apple\u00e2\u0080\u0099s advertising ID (IDFA) will be set to all an all-zero value: \n00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000\n. Read more about Apple advertising identifiers \nin their documentation\n.\n\n\nFor more information about the ATT framework, visit the \niOS 14 Guide\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAndroid Advertising IDs\n\n\nGoogle allows Android users to opt out from sharing their devices\u00e2\u0080\u0099 advertising IDs. Similar to Apple\u00e2\u0080\u0099s policy, Google will set a user\u00e2\u0080\u0099s advertising ID (GAID or AAID) to an all-zero value if that user has opted out from sharing their ID. Read more about Google\u00e2\u0080\u0099s advertising identifiers in \ntheir documentation\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCollect Integration-Specific Identifiers\n\n\nThe Web SDK can collect integration-specific identifiers to enrich the user data forwarded to your connected outputs.\n\n\nWhen \nCollect Integration-Specific Identifiers\n is checked, these integration-specific identifiers are collected and used to enrich your user data to help optimize the match rate of your audiences in downstream tools. Currently, these identifiers include Facebook\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \nfbc\n and \nfbp\n fields.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupported Integrations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVendor\n\n\nIdentifier\n\n\nCollection Method\n\n\nMaps to\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook Click ID\n\n\nfbclid\n\n\nurl query parameter\n\n\nFacebook.ClickId\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook Click ID\n\n\nfbc\n\n\nbrowser cookie\n\n\nFacebook.ClickId\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook Browser ID\n\n\nfbp\n\n\nbrowser cookie\n\n\nFacebook.BrowserId\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle GCLID\n\n\ngclid\n\n\nurl query parameter\n\n\nGoogleEnhancedConversions.Gclid\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle GWBRAID\n\n\ngwbraid\n\n\nurl query parameter\n\n\nGoogleEnhancedConversions.Gbraid\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle WBRAID\n\n\nwbraid\n\n\nurl query parameter\n\n\nGoogleEnhancedConversions.Wbraid\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTroubleshoot\n\n\nIf you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see data appearing in the Live Stream within the first few minutes after opening a development build:\n\n\n\n\nCheck that you have copied your Key and Secret correctly\n\n\nCheck that you have properly included the mParticle SDK in your project and it is correctly initialized. The necessary steps will differ depending on the platform.

gets shared across systems, applications and teams. It encompasses the following features:\n\n\n\n\nCatalog\n provides an overview of data collected, including detailed collection statistics. You can add descriptions and other information about data points in the catalog.\n\n\nData Plans\n allow you to define and then validate the extent and shape of the data that is collected.\n\n\nLive Stream\n allows you to observe data streaming into mParticle in realtime and to identify violations quickly if you are using a Data Plan to validate your data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding Data Points and Data Plans\n\n\n\n\nFor every mParticle workspace, you may have many data plans.\n\n\nEvery data plan contains one or more data plan versions.\n\n\nEach data plan version contains data points that you have defined.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA data point is a unit of data collected by mParticle. Data points represent Events such as Custom Events or Screen Views, or User attributes such as Customer Id or Email.\n\n\nEach data point includes criteria used to select the data point from an incoming data stream, and a definition called a schema that validates the contents of the data point. You can view data points in all three Data Master tools: Catalog, Live Stream, and Data Plan.\n\n\nFor example, here is a view of the Play Video data point in Catalog:\n\n\n\n\nHere is a view of the a Commerce Event data point in Live Stream:\n\n\n\n\nThis view of a data point is from Data Plan:\n\n\nWas this page helpful?\nYes\nNo\nLast Updated: \nJanuary 23, 2025\n\u00c2\u00a9 2025 mParticle, Inc.

Introduction\nReact Native\niOS\nAndroid\nJava\nJavaScript\nPython\nObject API\nDeveloper Basics\nAliasing\nStart capturing data\nAfter you create an input, you can begin capturing data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrerequisites\n\n\nBefore you start this activity, you should have already:\n\n\n\n\nCreated an input\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData in mParticle\n\n\nmParticle collects two important kinds of data: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvent data\n\n\nEvent data is about actions taken by a user in your app. Some events are collected automatically by mParticle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s native SDKs. These include the Session Start events you saw in the Live stream when you first \nset up your input\n. Other events need to be captured by writing code in your app. Of these, the most significant are:\n\n\n\n\nScreen/Page Views\n - keep track of where a user is in your app\n\n\nCustom Events\n - track any actions the user might take in your app, such as clicking a button or watching a video.\n\n\nCommerce Events\n - track purchases and other product-related activity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser data\n\n\nmParticle also captures data about your user, including their identities, information about the device they are using and any custom attributes you set. As with event data, some user data, such as information about the devices they use, is captured automatically by mParticle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s native SDKs. Two important types of user data must be captured by writing code in your app:\n\n\n\n\nUser identities\n are unique identifiers for your user, like an email address or customer ID. These are different from the device identities collected automatically by the SDKs, which don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t identify an individual person but a particular cell phone, browser session, or some other device. \nUser identities help mParticle keep track of unique users of your app and allow you to track a user\u00e2\u0080\u0099s activity over time and across different devices. To learn a lot more about user and device identities, read our \nIDSync\n guide. For now, you just need to know that a user identity is a way of identifying a \nperson\n, independently of the \ndevice\n they are currently using.\n\n\n\n\nUser Attributes\n are key-value pairs that can store any custom data about your user. The value of a user attribute can be:\n\n\n\n\nA string\n\n\nA number\n\n\nA list\n\n\nA boolean value (\ntrue\n or \nfalse\n)\n\n\nnull\n - attributes with a \nnull\n value function as \u00e2\u0080\u0098tags\u00e2\u0080\u0099, and can be used to sort your users into categories.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCapture User and Event Data\n\n\nTo start capturing data you will need to go back to your app code. In \nthe previous step\n you should have installed and initialized the mParticle SDK in at least one of your app platforms. This means you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re already set up to capture Session Start and Session End events, as well as basic data about the device. Grab a friendly developer again, if you need one, and try to add some additional user and event data to your implementation. Here are a few things you might try, with links to the appropriate developer docs:\n\n\n\n\nAdd a Customer ID or Email Address for a user.\nAndroid\n / \niOS\n / \nWeb\n \n\n\nCreate a custom user attribute that tells you something about a user. For example: \nstatus: \"premium\"\n.\nAndroid\n / \niOS\n / \nWeb\n \n\n\nCreate a page or screen view event that captures the name of a page or screen being viewed. \nAndroid\n / \niOS\n / \nWeb\n \n\n\nCreate a custom event to track a user action in your app. Include some custom attributes. For example, the mPTravel app sends a custom event when a user views one of its content videos. The event is called \u00e2\u0080\u009cPlay Video\u00e2\u0080\u009d and it has two custom attributes: the \ncategory\n of content, and the travel \ndestination\n the video promotes. Later on, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see how events like these can be used to target custom messaging. \nAndroid\n / \niOS\n / \nWeb\n\n\nCreate a purchase event - track a purchase using mParticle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s commerce APIs. \nAndroid\n / \niOS\n / \nWeb\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVerify: Look for incoming data in the Live Stream\n\n\nOnce you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve added code to your app to start collecting some basic data, start up a development build of your app again and trigger some events. Have another look at the Live Stream. You should start to see new event batches, with the individual events you have added to your app.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTroubleshoot\n\n\nIf you have at least some data in your Live Stream, such as the session start and session end messages generated in the \nprevious step\n, but your screen views, custom events or purchases aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t showing, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s likely that there is an issue with your app code.\n\n\n\n\nCheck that your code is correctly formed, and that the methods which send events to mParticle are actually triggered by user activity in your app.\n\n\nReview your development environment\u00e2\u0080\u0099s logs. These will show when an event is sent to mParticle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext steps\n\n\nExcellent, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve started collecting real custom datapoints from your app. At this point you might want to take a quick break to:\n\n\n\n\nExplore the capabilities of the \nLive Stream\n\n\nLearn more about the \nimportance of user identities\n in mParticle.\n\n\n\n\nNow that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re collecting data, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time to send it on by \nconnecting an event output\n.\nWas this page helpful?\nYes\nNo\nLast Updated: \nJanuary 23, 2025\n\u00c2\u00a9 2025 mParticle, Inc.

view the following video:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrerequisites\n\n\nBefore you start this activity, you should have already:\n\n\n\n\nCreated an input\n\n\nStarted to capture some basic data points\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOutputs\n\n\nOutputs are mParticle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s term for the services where we forward your data. Outputs are also referred to as \u00e2\u0080\u009cintegrations\u00e2\u0080\u009d. Outputs come in two types: \u00e2\u0080\u009cevent\u00e2\u0080\u009d, and \u00e2\u0080\u009caudience\u00e2\u0080\u009d. Audiences are covered in the \nnext part of this guide\n. This section will show you how to set up an event output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample - Connect an Output to Analytics\n\n\nmParticle has over a hundred event outputs, and the connection process for each is similar. This tutorial creates a connection to Analytics as an example. You can follow the same steps with a different output, or create a \nfree Analytics account\n to follow along exactly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFind Analytics in the Directory\n\n\n\n\nClick \nDirectory\n in the sidebar, and search for Analytics.\n\n\nClick the Analytics tile to display Output: Event Configuration.\n\n\n\n\nEnter the configuration information:\n\n\n\n\nEnter a configuration name.\n\n\nLeave the box checked to use the same settings for Development & Production.\n\n\nSelect a field as the user identity field. Leave the default if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure what to choose.\n\n\nEnter the Analytics API key which you can find in the Analytics project settings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemember to save your new output configuration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate the Connection\n\n\nNow that you have both an input and an output set up, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time to connect them:\n\n\n\n\nClick \nConnections > Connect\n, and select the input you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve already set up.  \n\n\nClick \nConnect Output\n.\n\n\nSelect your Analytics configuration.\n\n\nComplete the Connection Settings, different for each output. For Analytics you can leave the default selections.\n\n\nSet the status to \nActive\n and click \nSave\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVerify: Check that data is arriving in Analytics\n\n\nOnce you have enabled the connection, open up the development build of your app again and create a few more events. Each output service displays the data it receives differently. For Analytics, you can view real-time data in the \nDebug Console\n. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTroubleshoot\n\n\nIf you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see data arriving in the output service, navigate to \nData Master > Live Stream\n and select Message Direction Outbound.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you see messages in the outbound Live Stream, but none in the output service:\n\n\n\n\nYou may just need to wait. For most event outputs, mParticle forwards information in close to real time. However, there are factors which can slow down processing and the amount of time it takes for data to become visible in an output service\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dashboard can be different for each service.\n\n\nNavigate to \nActivity > System Alerts\n and see if there are any errors noted for the output you want to troubleshoot. The error type may give you a clue as to what is wrong.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the previous step doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t resolve the issue:\n\n\n\n\nCheck all of your Configuration and Connection settings. Make sure that all settings are correct, especially any access credentials, such as Project or App IDs, API Key & Secret, etc.\n\n\nIt is common for a particular output service to require certain identifiers or other data points to be present to allow data to be forwarded. As an example, the Google Ads output requires information about a user\u00e2\u0080\u0099s device, including the Device Advertising ID, in order to construct a User Agent Header. If the Device Advertising ID is not present, no data can be sent. Check the \ndocs\n for the output service and make sure you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re sending all the required information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf there are no outgoing messages in the Live Stream, then mParticle is not attempting to send any data to the output service. Some possible reasons for this include:\n\n\n\n\nNot all outputs support every platform or accept every event type. The Directory shows a list of available platforms and supported event types for each output. Make sure the data you are trying to send is supported.\n\n\nmParticle allows you to filter your data for each output. Check the \nData Filter\n to make sure you haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t turned off the data points you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re trying to send.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext steps\n\n\nBy now you should be successfully forwarding data to at least one event output. Some additional resources you might want to look at include:\n\n\n\n\nOne of the key benefits of mParticle is the power to collect data once and forward it to as many output services as you wish. Browse the \nIntegrations\n section of our docs to learn more about the different services mParticle can forward your data to.\n\n\nMost event outputs work by forwarding data server-side via the output partner\u00e2\u0080\u0099s HTTP API. However, some outputs require extra client-side code to be added to your native app, to allow data to be sent directly from your app to the output service. These integrations are called \u00e2\u0080\u009cembedded kits\u00e2\u0080\u009d. You can read more about them in the \niOS\n and \nAndroid\n documentation.\n\n\nSending web data to an output usually works a little differently from native. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re using mParticle on the web, read our guide to \nWorking with Web Data\n.\n\n\n\n\nNext up, you will learn about the second category of mParticle data by \ncreating an audience\n.\nWas this page helpful?\nYes\nNo\nLast Updated: \nJanuary 23, 2025\n\u00c2\u00a9 2025 mParticle, Inc.

Introduction\nReact Native\niOS\nAndroid\nJava\nJavaScript\nPython\nObject API\nDeveloper Basics\nAliasing\nAudiences Overview\nmParticle allows you to define audiences and connect them to integrations for the purpose of engaging with your users.  This can be very powerful when it comes to user engagement and monetization scenarios.\n\n\nYou can define audiences from any user-associated data you capture with mParticle, whether from platform inputs or partner feeds.\n\n\nWhen you fully instrument your app using the mParticle SDK, you send data from apps to the mParticle platform.  You can also enrich that data stream with other data sources.  For example, in addition to sending app data, you may want to send in data that is not collected in the app (server side data) and have the mParticle platform match the data based on a user identifier, and then create audiences based upon this superset of data.  Examples of data sent server side might include CRM data, purchase or revenue data from other non-mobile channels.  Make sure all the data that you need is captured is important; audience creation is the first step.\n\n\n\n  If you need to send data via our Events API, please \n contact our customer support team.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples\n\n\nUse audiences to drive user engagement, encourage app downloads, and more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDrive user engagement\n\n\nLet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s say you want to engage with users that have recently installed your app but haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t used your app very much.  Your objective is to drive higher engagement and convert those new users to high lifetime value users.  You want to accomplish this across multiple channels: push notification and email.  Therefore, your audience qualification criteria is that the user has installed your app in the last 72 hours and has less than three sessions.  \n\n\nYou can easily and visually define this audience, then configure audience integrations to push notification and email partners - in this example, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s use Button for push and Mailchimp for email.  Once you configure the respective integrations, mParticle instantiates a corresponding audience in Button and updates the corresponding email marketing list in Mailchimp.  No coding is necessary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDrive app downloads\n\n\nLet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s say you want to find more users like your currently highly engaged users and run an app download campaign in Facebook against that target audience. You start by defining your highly engaged users, using whatever criteria is important to you: lifetime value metrics, session activity, event activity, or any other data points you capture.  \n\n\nOnce your audience is defined, configure the Facebook integration and corresponding custom audiences in your Facebook account.  From there you can leverage the custom audiences like any other custom audience in Facebook.  \n\n\nBecause we want to target users that look like our highly engaged users, we will create a Facebook lookalike audience from our highly engaged user audience and run a Facebook app install campaign that targets that lookalike audience.\n\n\nmParticle provides two types of audiences:\n\n\n\n\nReal-time audiences\n, available in all mParticle accounts\n\n\nStandard audiences\n, a premium feature\n\n\nWas this page helpful?\nYes\nNo\nLast Updated: \nJanuary 23, 2025\n\u00c2\u00a9 2025 mParticle, Inc.

about your event data. \n\n\nThe following video provides an overview of the Activity dashboard:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nThe Activity Overview tracks basic stats for your workspace:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nActivity\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal Active\n\n\nCount of all users that were active in your apps or websites.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApp Installs\n\n\nCount of application state transition \u00e2\u0080\u009cinstall\u00e2\u0080\u009d events. The Web SDK does not track \u00e2\u0080\u009cinstall\u00e2\u0080\u009d events, so this metric only applies to the mobile platform SDKs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSessions\n\n\nCount of sessions in your apps or websites.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Session\n\n\nAverage session length.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvents Received\n\n\nCount of events received. Use this value for diagnostic purposes and to help understand what data was being ingested in real time. The event counts are approximate and don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t include some events, such as those with \nold timestamps\n. It does include some events like consent grants and denials that aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t included in the monthly Credit Usage Report, which details usage-based billing for value-based pricing customers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvents Forwarded\n\n\nCount of events forwarded to outputs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlerts\n\n\nDisplays the number of alerts which occurred when forwarding data to an output service.  \n Only the \nFatal\n alert type is displayed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRevenue\n\n\nDisplays total revenue.  \n This tab is only shown if there is a non-zero amount of revenue to display.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll metrics can be filtered by date range, environment and input.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdentity\n\n\n\n\nDisplays summary metrics for identity data collected about your users:\n\n\n\n\n% of Users\n: The percentage of users that have a given identity type.\n\n\nOverlaps\n: The percentage of users and count that have a combination of the two given identity types.\n\n\n\n\nThis section is filterable by the date range, environment and input options at the top of the page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConnections\n\n\n\n\nDisplays summary information representing the current workspace\u00e2\u0080\u0099s usage, showing the following metrics:\n\n\nInputs\n\n\n\n\nActive Platforms\n: Count of platforms configured with credentials.\n\n\nActive Feeds\n: Count of configured inbound feeds.\n\n\nCustom Events\n: Count of custom events received.\n\n\nUser Attributes\n: Count of user attributes received.\n\n\n\n\nOutputs\n\n\n\n\nActive Event Integrations\n: Count of active event configurations.\n\n\nActive Audience Integrations\n: Count of active audience configurations.\n\n\nActive Real-time Audiences\n: Count of active real-time audiences.\n\n\nStandard Audiences\n: Count of \u00e2\u0080\u0098ready\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Standard Audiences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser Activity\n\n\nThe User Activity view allows you to see a detailed summary of data associated with a single user. Note that only users with the Admin or Support roles can access the User Activity view.\n\n\nTo find a user, begin entering any known ID for the user, an email address, customer ID, device ID, etc. The ID must match exactly to return a profile. If multiple profiles are returned, select the user you want from the list.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser Search\n\n\nYou can search for any element in your Identity Set.\nTo perform a search do the following:\n\n\n\n\nNavigate to the \nActivity\n > \nUser Activity\n screen. The User Search dialog displays on the screen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter the search terms in the search field.\n\n\n\n\nYou can narrow your search by clicking the Any Profile field drop-down and selecting any field that is part of your Identity Set.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can search for users that belong to a \ngroup identity\n by searching for the group identifier or group attribute for the group.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick the Search button. The screen refreshes and search results are displayed in the Information screen.\n\n\n\n\nView individual results by clicking a row. From the individual results you can do the following:\n\n\n\n\nSubmit a New GDPR Request. For more information about GDPR requests, see \nSubject Requests\n\n\nView User Events by clicking the \nEvents\n tab or by scrolling to the bottom of the screen and clicking the \nView User Events\n button\n\n\nExpand any of the sections on the Information screen for more information about your results\n\n\n\n\nThe information shown on this screen is explained in the following sections.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInformation\n\n\nThe following user information will be displayed if available:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser Details\n\n\n\n\nmParticle ID\n\n\nCustomer ID\n\n\nEmail Address\n\n\nFirst and last seen dates (across all workspaces)\n\n\n\n\nBad User tag:\n On rare occasions, the User Details section will display a \nBad User\n tag. This indicates that the mParticle backend noticed a suspiciously high event or device volume. If you see this tag and wish to learn more, contact support. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorkspace Usage\n\n\n\n\nFirst and last seen dates (for the individual workspace)\n\n\nData Inputs and Partner Feeds the user has appeared in.\n\n\nDevice ID - only one Device ID will be shown, for the most recently seen device. The Advertising ID (IDFA or GAID) will be shown for preference, with the Vendor ID (IDFV or Android ID) as a fallback.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevices\n\n\nList of all devices, including the date the device was last seen, device platform (iOS, Android, etc) and whether \nLimit Ad Tracking\n is enabled for the device.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser Attributes\n\n\nList of all available user attributes. Display priority is given to reserved user attributes:\n\n\n\n\nAge\n\n\nFirst Name\n\n\nLast Name\n\n\nGender\n\n\nMobile Number\n\n\nAddress\n\n\nCity\n\n\nState\n\n\nZip Code\n\n\nCountry\n\n\n\n\nAll other user attributes will be displayed in alphabetical order.\n\n\nUser attribute values may be updated by different inbound data streams. For example, a profile may be created, attributes may be added, updated, or deleted. Each change triggers a timestamp change for the altered attribute. When resolving differences in attribute values for the same profile, the value with the latest timestamp is used.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttribution\n\n\nA list of campaigns, showing Partner and Campaign name.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAudience Membership\n\n\nA list of all \nAudiences\n the user is a member of.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\nThe Events tab will show a timeline of historical event data from the user, \nup until the previous day\n. Events can be filtered by Date, Input, Event Type and Device. In addition to filtering, you can also choose to highlight selected event names in the timeline.\n\n\n\n  The Last Updated tag in the UAV Events view indicates the last time the data was refreshed on the page, not when the previous day's data has been loaded.  The timezone for this tag is UTC.\n\n\n\nEvents are grouped in batches, with the input source in bold. Click a batch heading to view common attributes for the batch, or an event name to view attributes for the event. eCommerce events show details for the transaction and also for each product, including quantity and total price per product.\n\n\n\n\n\nEvent data received with an \nevent timestamp\n that is 72 hours older than the time it is received will not be captured in this report. For example: Today is February 24, 2022 at 11:00 UTC, I send an event to the API with event timestamp February 21, 2022 at 10:00 UTC. The report for February 21, 2022 view will not count the event.\n\n\n\nClick the Link button in the details view to copy a sharable direct link to the event to your clipboard.\n\n\nAs with the \nLive Stream\n You can expand any event or batch to view the raw JSON data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit a user profile\n\n\nThe User Activity View allows you to manually edit certain properties of individual user profiles. This can be useful if you need to correct profile data and you want the updated profile data to be immediately forwarded to your downstream connections.\n\n\nWhenever you modify user profile data, you must select one of your configured inputs. This allows mParticle to route your changes through that input, updating the user profile, before finally forwarding the changes to any active, connected outputs.\n\n\n\nIf you do not want your changes to be forwarded to any downstream outputs, either create or select an input that does not have any connected outputs. \n\n\n\n\nEach time you click \nUpdate\n to commit your changes to the user profile, a new eventless batch is ingested into mParticle. These batches count towards your event counts for event-based pricing, and will potentially impact your MTU counts under MTU-based pricing.\n\n\n\n\nChanges are committed to profiles in mParticle in real time, but propagation to your connected outputs can take up to 48 hours, depending on the integrations you use. For details, refer to the documentation for your integrations or contact your mParticle account representative.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit a profile\u00e2\u0080\u0099s user attributes\n\n\nTo edit a profile\u00e2\u0080\u0099s user attributes:\n\n\n\n\nNavigate to \nActivity > User Activity\n using the left-hand nav bar.\n\n\nFind the profile you want to edit by searching for one of the profile\u00e2\u0080\u0099s identifiers under User Search.\n\n\n\n\nOn the Information tab for the profile, scroll to the User Attributes section and click the \nEdit\n pencil icon next to the mParticle workspace where you want to make your changes.\n\n\n\n\nRemember that user attributes are scoped at the workspace level, so a profile that exists in multiple workspaces may contain different attributes in each workspace.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the Edit modal, select one of your configured and active inputs. The changes you make will be sent to every output that is connected to the input you select. If you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want your changes sent to your downstream outputs, create or select an input that has no connected outputs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Edit modal displays a list of the profile\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attributes and attribute values. To change an attribute value, modify or replace it using the text box to the right of the attribute\u00e2\u0080\u0099s name.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo permanently delete an attribute from a profile, click the \ndelete\n trash icon next to the attribute.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve made your changes, click \nUpdate\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit a profile\u00e2\u0080\u0099s consent values\n\n\n\n\nNavigate to \nActivity > User Activity\n using the left-hand nav bar.\n\n\nFind the profile you want to edit by searching for one of the profile\u00e2\u0080\u0099s identifiers under User Search.\n\n\n\n\nOn the Information tab for the profile, scroll to the Consent and Compliance section and click the \nEdit\n pencil icon next to the mParticle workspace where you want to make your changes.\n\n\n\n\nRemember that user consent and compliance values are scoped at the workspace level, so a profile that exists in multiple workspaces may contain different values in each workspace.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the Edit modal, select one of your configured and active inputs. The changes you make will be sent to every output that is connected to the input you select. If you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want your changes sent to your downstream outputs, create or select an input that has no connected outputs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Edit modal lists the profile\u00e2\u0080\u0099s consent purposes (which are not editable) and the corresponding consent values. You can edit a consent value by entering either \ntrue\n or \nfalse\n in the text box.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntrue\n and \nfalse\n are the only valid values you can user when setting the consent state for a user profile.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve made your changes, click \nUpdate\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit a profile\u00e2\u0080\u0099s user identities\n\n\n\n\nNavigate to \nActivity > User Activity\n using the left-hand nav bar.\n\n\nFind the profile you want to edit by searching for one of the profile\u00e2\u0080\u0099s identifiers under User Search.\n\n\n\n\nOn the Information tab for the profile, look for the User Details section and click the \nEdit\n pencil icon.\n\n\n\n\nRemember that user identities values are scoped at the organization level: a user\u00e2\u0080\u0099s identities are consistent between all workspaces in your mParticle organization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the modal that appears, select one of your configured and active inputs. The changes you make will be sent to every output that is connected to the input you select. If you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want your changes sent to your downstream outputs, create or select an input that has no connected outputs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo edit one of the profile\u00e2\u0080\u0099s identities, enter the new value in the text box to the right of the user identity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo delete an identity from a profile, click the \ndelete\n trash icon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve made your changes, click \nUpdate\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd an identity to a profile\n\n\nTo add an identity to a user profile:\n\n\n\n\nRepeat steps 1-4 of \nEdit a profile\u00e2\u0080\u0099s user identities\n.\n\n\nClick \nAdd Identity\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the left dropdown menu to select the type of identity to add, and enter the value of the new identity in the text box on the right.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick \nUpdate\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSystem Alerts\n\n\nThe System Alerts dashboard reports all errors returned when forwarding data to your connected outputs. This dashboard helps you to find any connections that are failing to forward data, and it can help you to begin debugging a connection you already know is experiencing problems by highlighting the specific errors reported.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSystem Alerts dashboard\n\n\nTo view system alerts, log into your mParticle account and navigate to \nActivity > System Alerts\n in the left nav bar.\n\n\n\n\nThe System Alerts dashboard lists all of your connections sorted by their alert volume, from high to low according to alerts reported during the last 12 hours.\n\n\nYou can view alerts reported during different date ranges by using the \nDate\n dropdown menu.\n\n\n\n   All times on the System Alerts dashboard are displayed in UTC. \n\n\n\nTo view alerts reported for only the production or development environment, select the environment using the \nEnvironment\n dropdown menu. You can also look for a specific connection with the search bar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlert details\n\n\nTo view details on the specific alerts reported for a connection, select it from the list labeled \nConnections\n.\n\n\n\n\nThe alerts displayed are sorted by volume and organized according to their type.

This is where you can verify how much data mParticle captured per event, and how much data was forwarded.  If multiple configurations are enabled for an integration, the data sent to each configuration will be shown separately. We recommend checking this report if you notice any discrepancies in your vendor dashboards.\n\n\n\nEvent data received with an \nevent timestamp\n that is 72 hours older than the time it is received will not be captured in this report. For example: Today is February 24, 2022 at 11:00 UTC, I send an event to the API with event timestamp February 21, 2022 at 10:00 UTC. The report for February 21, 2022 view will not count the event. Please work with mParticle Support to pull a report of total event counts if sending backdated data.\n\n\n\nThe report displays a daily summary of events, plus counts for each message type and event name, along with the inbound and outbound counts for each enabled service.  By default a summary of data for a full day is shown, but you can also select a specific hour to display hourly data.\n\n\nYou may notice differences between an inbound data count and an outbound data count. There are several reasons these differences may occur. Here are some good questions to start with:\n\n\n\n\nDid you enable/disable the service on the date in question?\n\n\nAre you using data filters?\n\n\nIs the message type not supported by the integration?\n\n\nHave you chosen configuration or connection settings that exclude certain message types?\n\n\nAre you sending \ncommerce events\n that are expanded before being forwarded?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommerce Event Types and Event Forwarding\n\n\nFour events, called commerce events, capture information about financial transactions: product commerce events, purchase or refund commerce events, promotion commerce events, and impression commerce events. \n\n\nCommerce events behave differently from other events:\n\n\n\n\nIf the event is forwarded using an mParticle SDK with an embedded kit that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t implement \nlogCommerceEvent\n, then the event is expanded to ensure that no data is lost.\n\n\nIf the event is forwarded server-to-server or using an mParticle SDK with an embedded kit that does support \nlogCommerceEvent\n, then no expansion is needed, and no data is lost. \n\n\n\n\nIn addition, the expansion behavior is different depending on the commerce event type:\n\n\n\n\nProduct commerce events and impression commerce events expand to one event per product.\n\n\nPurchase or refund commerce events add an additional event with the total value.\n\n\nPromotion commerce events expand to one event per promotion action type such as \u00e2\u0080\u009cclick\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009cview.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\n\nFor more details, see the \niOS SDK\n or \nAndroid SDK\n documentation.\nWas this page helpful?\nYes\nNo\nLast Updated: \nJanuary 23, 2025\n\u00c2\u00a9 2025 mParticle, Inc.

and CCPA with Data Privacy Controls. This feature is not prescriptive and there is no single way to implement consent or opt-out. Instead, mParticle gives you a simple, standard technique for storing and applying consent and opt-out choices. Consent state powers both GDPR consent and CCPA data sale opt-out.\n\n\nThis guide introduces you to mParticle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s data privacy control functionality and shows you how to collect an individual\u00e2\u0080\u0099s consent and apply it to your data flows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommon uses of data privacy controls\n\n\nData privacy controls are flexible and customizable, allowing you to build any data flow or consent-based logic you need.\n\n\nUse mParticle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s data privacy controls to help comply with CCPA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cdo not sell my data\u00e2\u0080\u009d requirement by collecting users who opt-out and blocking those users\u00e2\u0080\u0099 data from flowing to any \u00e2\u0080\u0098data sale\u00e2\u0080\u0099 output by:\n\n\n\n\nRecording a CCPA data sale opt-out as a user consent (more information below)\n\n\nIdentify which outputs count as \u00e2\u0080\u0098data sale\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and apply the below forwarding rule to them\n\n\nApplying a forwarding rule of: Do not forward if CCPA Data sale opt out is present\n\n\n\n\nGDPR defines consent as one method of lawful data processing.

GDPR recognizes several different purposes for data collection including the possibility of a user consenting to some purposes of data collection but not others. mParticle does not limit you to a specific set of purposes, but rather lets you define your own purposes when you set up a workspace.\n\n\n\nFor CCPA, once it is enabled in your workspace, the purpose \ndata_sale_opt_out\n is automatically created. The SDKs and mParticle UIs facilitate using this purpose, so you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need to hardcode it anywhere.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsent properties\n\n\nThe mParticle format for a single record of a user decision on a privacy prompt, \n.consent\n, is our \nconsent_state\n object. This is used for both GDPR-style opt-in consent and for CCPA-style opt-out.\n\n\nFor each user or workspace, consent state can be stored for each possible combination of regulation and purpose. For each purpose, the following fields are supported.\n\n\nAll fields are optional, except \nconsented\n, \ntimestamp_unixtime_ms\n, \nregulation\n and \npurpose\n. The \nregulation\n and \npurpose\n fields are built into the structure. Be sure to include your privacy and compliance experts when deciding how to implement optional fields.\n\n\nThe `consented` field indicates the user's decision to the data processing defined in the purpose. It does not imply any additional permissions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProperty\n\n\nType, Required\n\n\nExample Values\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nregulation\n\n\nstring\n Required\n\n\ngdpr\n\n\nThe regulation under which a user consent or preference is being saved.

For GDPR, purposes must be defined in mParticle before using them in a consent_state object. For CCPA, this is not required as the default CCPA purpose is \ndata_sale_opt_out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nconsented\n\n\nbool\n \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0 Required\n\n\ntrue\n / \nfalse\n\n\nFor GDPR, this records the user\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decision on the prompted consent purpose. If the user agreed (\ntrue\n) or rejected (\nfalse\n). For CCPA, set this to \ntrue\n if the user has opted-out of data sale and \nfalse\n if they have not opted-out of data sale.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntimestamp_unixtime_ms\n\n\nnumber\n Required\n\n\n1510949166\n\n\nA timestamp for the creation of the consent state. mParticle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s SDKs send this field automatically.

Here is an example of how CCPA data sale opt-out will appear:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAudiences\n\n\nConsent state can be used to create conditions in the Audience Builder to check a users\u00e2\u0080\u0099 consent state as a requirement for audience inclusion or exclusion.\n\n\nFor example, for CCPA you may want to include only users who have NOT opted out of data sale, by adding a criteria like this:\n\n\n\n\nFor GDPR, you may want to include only users that have an opt-in consent for a given purpose, shown here as \u00e2\u0080\u0098Advertising\u00e2\u0080\u0099:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConnections and forwarding rules\n\n\nConsent state can be used to create forwarding rules that selectively filter data based on a users consent state, in real time and per-person.\n\n\nFor example, you can choose to only forward data from users who have given consent for a particular purpose.\n\n\n\nFor CCPA, you may want a forwarding rule to apply a data sale opt-out. In this example, users\u00e2\u0080\u0099 who have a consent state of \ntrue\n for the CCPA purpose of \ndata_sale_opt_out\n will NOT have their data forwarded (if the consent state is missing or false for that purpose, data will flow):\n\n\n\nFor GDPR, you may want a forwarding rule to only send data when a single purpose is consented:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKits and forwarding rules\n\n\nIf you set up a Forwarding Rule for an embedded kit integration, the iOS and Android SDKs will check consent status for the user on initialization. If the rule condition fails, the kit will not be initialized. Note that kits are only initialized when a session begins or on user change, so if consent status changes in the course of a session, while mParticle will immediately stop forwarding data to the kit, it is possible that an embedded kit may remain active and independently forwarding data to a partner from the client until the session ends.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForwarding consent state to partners\n\n\nWhen the consent state of a profile changes, that change can be communicated to mParticle event integrations. If the \nconsent_state\n object on an incoming event batch contains changes from the existing profile, mParticle adds a \u00e2\u0080\u0098system notification\u00e2\u0080\u0099 to the batch for each consent state change before the batch is sent to incoming forwarders. This notification contains the full old and new consent state objects:\n\n\n\"system_notifications\"\n:\n \n[\n\n \n{\n\n   \n\"data\"\n:\n \n{\n\n     \n\"purpose\"\n:\n \n\"location_collection\"\n,\n\n     \n\"current\"\n:\n \n{\n\n       \n\"regulation\"\n:\n \n\"GDPR\"\n,\n\n       \n\"document\"\n:\n \n\"location_collection_agreement_v4\"\n,\n\n       \n\"consented\"\n:\n \nfalse\n,\n\n       \n\"timestamp_unixtime_ms\"\n:\n \n1523045332033\n,\n\n       \n\"location\"\n:\n \n\"17 Cherry Tree Lane\"\n,\n\n       \n\"hardware_id\"\n:\n \n\"IDFA:a5d934n0-232f-4afc-2e9a-3832d95zc702\"\n\n     \n}\n,\n\n     \n\"old\"\n:\n \n{\n\n       \n\"regulation\"\n:\n \n\"GDPR\"\n,\n\n       \n\"document\"\n:\n \n\"location_collection_agreement_v4\"\n,\n\n       \n\"consented\"\n:\n \ntrue\n,\n\n       \n\"timestamp_unixtime_ms\"\n:\n \n1523039002083\n,\n\n       \n\"location\"\n:\n \n\"17 Cherry Tree Lane\"\n,\n\n       \n\"hardware_id\"\n:\n \n\"IDFA:a5d934n0-232f-4afc-2e9a-3832d95zc702\"\n\n     \n}\n\n   \n}\n,\n\n   \n\"type\"\n:\n \n\"gdpr_change\"\n\n \n}\n\n\n]\n\n\nThere are currently two ways that consent state changes are forwarded to mParticle event integrations:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome partners accept raw event batch data from mParticle, mostly for data storage or custom analytics use cases. For these partners, mParticle will forward the \u00e2\u0080\u0098system_notifications\u00e2\u0080\u0099 object with each relevant event batch. Forwarding of system notifications can be turned off with a user setting. Integrations that can currently receive the system notifications object include:\n\n\n\n\nAmazon Kinesis\n\n\nAmazon S3\n\n\nAmazon SNS\n\n\nAmazon SQS\n\n\nGoogle Pub/Sub\n\n\nGoogle Cloud Storage\n\n\nMicrosoft Azure Event Hubs\n\n\nSlack\n\n\nWebhook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmParticle is working with other partners to support forwarding consent state changes as a Custom Event. These events contain the new consent state information as custom attributes, a custom event type of \n\"Consent\"\n, and an event name of \n\"Consent Given\"\n or \n\"Consent Rejected\"\n. These consent events are forwarded to supporting partners as standard custom events.\n\n\n{\n\n \n\"data\"\n:\n \n{\n\n   \n\"event_name\"\n:\n \n\"Consent Given\"\n,\n\n   \n\"custom_event_type\"\n:\n \n\"Consent\"\n,\n\n   \n\"custom_attributes\"\n:\n \n{\n\n     \n\"consented\"\n:\n \n\"true\"\n,\n\n     \n\"document\"\n:\n \n\"location_collection_agreement_v4\"\n,\n\n     \n\"hardware_id\"\n:\n \n\"IDFA:a5d934n0-232f-4afc-2e9a-3832d95zc702\"\n,\n\n     \n\"purpose\"\n:\n \n\"location_collection\"\n,\n\n     \n\"location\"\n:\n \n\"17 Cherry Tree Lane\"\n,\n\n     \n\"regulation\"\n:\n \n\"GDPR\"\n,\n\n     \n\"timestamp_unixtime_ms\"\n:\n \n1523039002083\n\n   \n}\n,\n\n   \n\"event_type\"\n:\n \n\"custom_event\"\n\n \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\nPartners that currently accept these custom consent state events include:\n\n\n\n\nAmplitude\n\n\nSnowplow\n\n\nMixpanel\n\n\nGoogle Analytics\n\n\nSalesforce DMP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00e2\u0080\u009cGDPR Consent Change\u00e2\u0080\u009d is  listed as a data type in the \nIntegrations directory\n and we will update this list as more partners add support. Please reach out to your success manager if you would like to distribute consent to an additional partner.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData subject requests\n\n\nmParticle helps you respond to \ndata subject requests\n as mandated by the GDPR and CCPA regulations.\n\n\nYou can search for integrations that support data subject requests in the \nIntegrations\n page. Search on category \nData Subject Request\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIngest GPC signals\n\n\nThe California Consumer Protection Act (CCPA) and the upcoming CPRA (California Privacy Rights Act) require that users can signal their privacy choices. In support of that requirement, you can ingest \nGlobal Privacy Control (GPC) signals\n with mParticle.\n\n\nBrowsers append the GPC signal to HTTP requests and make it queryable via the DOM. This signal is designed to convey a person\u00e2\u0080\u0099s request to websites and services to not sell or share their personal information with third parties, per \nthe Global Privacy Control specification\n. This opt-out is at the browser level, allowing users to turn on the GPC signal for all or specific websites.\n\n\nThe workflow for ingesting and forwarding GPC signals via SDK or Events API:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSample code for GPC\n\n\nThis sample code show two options: mapping to a GDPR purpose and mapping to a user attribute.\n\n\n/*\n First, grab the GPC signal. \"true\" indicates the user has signaled an opt-out\n See here for more details on querying the GPC signal:\n https://globalprivacycontrol.github.io/gpc-spec/\n*/\n\n\nvar\n gpcSignal \n=\n navigator\n.\nglobalPrivacyControl\n;\n\n\n\n\n/*\n Option 1:\n In this example, the GPC signal is mapped to a \"targeting_collection\" GDPR purpose.\n This is only an example, you determine the GDPR purposes and how GPC maps to them.\n You can do the same mapping to CPPA.\n*/\n\n\nvar\n targeting_consent \n=\n mParticle\n.\nConsent\n.\ncreateGDPRConsent\n(\n\n   \n!\ngpcSignal\n,\n \n// note that this is inverted\n\n   Date\n.\nnow\n(\n)\n,\n \n// Timestamp\n\n   \n\"browser_gpc_signal\"\n,\n \n// Document\n\n   \n\"17 Cherry Tree Lane\"\n,\n \n// Location\n\n   \n\"browser-id:a5d934n0-232f-4afc-2e9a-3832d95zc702\"\n \n// Hardware ID\n\n\n)\n;\n\n\n\n\n// Add to your consent state\n\n\nvar\n consentState \n=\n mParticle\n.\nConsent\n.\ncreateConsentState\n(\n)\n;\n\nconsentState\n.\naddGDPRConsentState\n(\n\"targeting_collection\"\n,\n targeting_consent\n)\n;\n\n\nvar\n user \n=\n mParticle\n.\nIdentity\n.\ngetCurrentUser\n(\n)\n;\n\nuser\n.\nsetConsentState\n(\nconsentState\n)\n;\n\n\n\n\n/*\n Option 2:\n In this example, the GPC signal is mapped to a user attribute\n*/\n\n\nvar\n user \n=\n mParticle\n.\nIdentity\n.\ngetCurrentUser\n(\n)\n;\n\nuser\n.\nsetUserAttribute\n(\n\"gpc_signal\"\n,\n gpcSignal\n)\n;\nWas this page helpful?\nYes\nNo\nLast Updated: \nJanuary 23, 2025\n\u00c2\u00a9 2025 mParticle, Inc.

Introduction\nReact Native\niOS\nAndroid\nJava\nJavaScript\nPython\nObject API\nDeveloper Basics\nAliasing\nImport Data with CSV Files\nYou can import bulk data, both user attribute and events, from your data warehouse or legacy system using comma separated values (CSV) files. You can use this technique in all regions and with all outputs.\n\n\nUse the following process to load user attribute or event data from CSV files:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Create CSV files\n\n\n\n\nFile guidelines\n\n\nData guidelines\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Get credentials for the mParticle SFTP server\n\n\n3. Configure the Custom CSV Feed\n\n\n4. Drop CSV files on the SFTP server\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Create CSV files\n\n\nPrepare the CSV files for import. Files must follow the guidelines in this section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFile guidelines\n\n\n\n\nFiles must adhere to the \nRFC4180 standards\n for CSV formatting. \n\n\n\n\nFiles must be sent in one of the following formats:\n\n\n\n\nA plain CSV (\n.csv\n)\n\n\nA ZIP file containing one or more CSV files (\n.zip\n)\n\n\nA gzipped CSV (\n.csv.gz\n).\n\n\nA PGP/GPG-encrypted file with the additional extension \n.gpg\n appended, for example, \n.csv.gpg\n or \n.csv.gz.gpg\n). Only encrypted OR unencrypted files can be accepted, but not both.  You must use PGP encryption with mParticle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s public key. See \nEncrypted files\n for additional instructions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFile sizes should be between 5 MB and 2 GB. If you upload files outside these limits, processing speed is slower. If possible, split the data across multiple small files, because their processing can be parallelized.\n\n\nEach file can only contain events of the same event type. You can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mix events of different types in the same file.\n\n\nDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t use subfolders.\n\n\nEach row size should be under 80 KB. Larger rows may impact performance.\n\n\nAll column names must be unique.\n\n\nEach CSV file must contain fewer than 50 columns.\n\n\n\n\nFile name requirements:\n\n\n\n\nDo not use any dashes ( - ) or dots ( . ) in your file name, other than what is described below.\n\n\nEnd the file name based on the event content in your file:\n\n-custom_event.csv\n\n\n-commerce_event.csv\n\n\n-screen_view.csv\n\n\n-eventless.csv\n for eventless uploads of user identities and attributes \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColumn names: specify fields according to our \nJSON Schema\n, using dot notation.\n\n\n\n\nColumn names described are case sensitive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData guidelines\n\n\n\n\nEnvironment: include a column name \nenvironment\n set to \ndevelopment\n or \nproduction\n. If an \nenvironment\n column is not included, data is ingested into the production environment.\n\n\n\n\nUser and Device IDs: as with any data sent to mParticle, you must include a column with at least one user ID or device ID.  \n\n\n  Device IDs\n\n\n\n\ndevice_info.android_advertising_id\n\n\ndevice_info.android_uuid\n\n\ndevice_info.ios_advertising_id\n\n\ndevice_info.att_authorization_status\n\n\ndevice_info.ios_idfv\n\n\ndevice_info.roku_advertising_id\n\n\ndevice_info.roku_publisher_id\n\n\ndevice_info.fire_advertising_id\n\n\ndevice_info.microsoft_advertising_id\n\n\n\n\n  User IDs\n\n\n\n\nmpid\n \n\n\nuser_identities.customerid\n \n\n\nuser_identities.email\n\n\nuser_identities.facebook\n\n\nuser_identities.microsoft\n\n\nuser_identities.twitter\n\n\nuser_identities.yahoo\n\n\nuser_identities.other\n\n\nuser_identities.other2\n\n\nuser_identities.other3\n\n\nuser_identities.other4\n\n\n\n\nImportant: CSV files must have all the required identity columns, and the rows must have valid values in those columns to prevent processing errors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser attributes:\n\n\n  If you include user attributes, for each, include a column named as \nuser_attributes.key\n, where \nkey\n is a user attribute key. For example:\n\n\n\n\nuser_attributes.$FirstName\n\n\nuser_attributes.communication_preference\n\n\nuser_attributes.Member Tier\n\n\n\n\n  Attribute names with spaces are allowed and do not require quotes. All the keys listed in the \nJSON Reference\n are supported.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvents:\n\n\n\n\nUse a column named \nevents.data.timestamp_unixtime_ms\n to set the event time.\n\n\nUse a column named  \nevents.data.custom_attributes.key\n, where \nkey\n is an event attribute key, to set custom event attributes.\n\nAttribute names with spaces are allowed and do not require quotes. All the keys listed in the \nJSON Reference\n are supported.\n\n\nScreen view events: use a column named \nevents.data.screen_name\n if you want to include the screen name.\n\n\nCustom events: use columns named \nevents.data.event_name\n and \nevents.data.custom_event_type\n to include custom events.\n\n\n\n\nCommerce events: use columns with the following names for commerce events.  \n\n\n\n\nevents.data.product_action.action\n\n\nevents.data.product_action.products.id\n\n\nevents.data.product_action.products.name\n\n\nevents.data.product_action.products.category\n\n\nevents.data.product_action.products.brand\n\n\nevents.data.product_action.products.variant\n\n\nevents.data.product_action.products.position\n\n\nevents.data.product_action.products.price\n\n\nevents.data.product_action.products.quantity\n\n\nevents.data.product_action.products.coupon_code\n\n\nevents.data.product_action.products.added_to_cart_time_ms\n\n\nevents.data.product_action.products.total_product_amount\n\n\nevents.data.product_action.products.custom_attributes\n\n\n\n\nOnly one product per event can be included for commerce events uploaded via CSV.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData types:\n\n\nAll data in the CSV is converted to a string. The only exceptions to this are values that require a particular data type, such as MPID or IDFA.\n\n\n\n\nOnly standard custom events and screen views, and eventless batches (eventless drops of user identity and attributes), have been tested.\n\n\nAttributes sent as arrays are not fully supported. When the entire array is present in a single cell of the CSV file, it is supported and is converted to string. Because there is no way of specifying anything but the first item in an array, repeated header columns, each subsequent column overwrites the previous one. Multiple columns don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t append to the array. This is why you can only include one product for ecommerce events. Commerce events in the Events API support arrays in multiple places, but with CSV files, you can only populate a single item in each of these arrays.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustom manifest: You can use a custom manifest to drop files created in another system without transforming them. For details, see \nUse a custom manifest\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Get credentials for the mParticle SFTP server\n\n\nmParticle maintains an SFTP server where you will drop your CSV files.\nUse the following instructions to securely retrieve your credentials and find the hostname and path to use when you drop your files on the SFTP server.\n\n\nTo get your SFTP username and password:\n\n\n\n\nSign up for a Keybase account with your work email at \nhttps://keybase.io/\n. Keybase is a secure tool which includes end-to-end encrypted chat.\n\n\nProvide your Keybase account name to your Customer Success Manager or your mParticle Solutions Consultant so that they can pass it on to our Ops team.\n\n\nExpect to receive your SFTP access credentials in a Keybase chat from mParticle. Note that if you need to use credentials that you already have, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll share those credentials in the Keybase chat.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Configure the Custom CSV Feed\n\n\nConfigure the Custom CSV Feed as input. This step provides the hostname and folder path on the SFTP server where your CSV files must be dropped.  \n\n\nSubdirectories within this drop folder are not supported.  To maintain multiple directories, configure a different input for each directory.\n\n\nTo configure the Custom CSV Feed:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisit \nSETUP > Inputs > Feeds\n in the mParticle UI and click the \nAdd Feed Input\n button, then select Custom CSV Feed from the list.\n\n\n\nIf you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve already added the Custom CSV Feed, it won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up in the list. Scroll through the list of feeds until you see \nCustom CSV Feed\n, and then click the large plus sign in the gray bar to create a new feed. You need one feed for each different event type. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter the following values:\n\n\n\n\nConfiguration Name\n: enter a name that makes this feed easy to recognize in your list of feeds.\n\n\nCustom Event Name\n: if you are importing a custom event, enter the name that will be used for the custom event.\n\n\nCustom Event Type\n: if you entered a custom event name, select the event type.\n\n\nCustom Manifest\n: if you are using a \ncustom manifest\n, paste it in the text box provided.\n\n\n Expect Encrypted Files\n: if you will import a PGP/GPG-encrypted file, select this option.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter you complete the connection configuration, click \nIssue SFTP Details\n. mParticle displays your hostname and path for mParticle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s SFTP server.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Drop CSV files on the SFTP server\n\n\n\n\nConnect to the mParticle SFTP server using the credentials provided. Once you have connected, the mParticle creates the \ndrop\n folder. If you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see one, create a folder named \ndrop\n.\n\n\nCreate a new folder inside the \ndrop\n folder, and name it using the pathname provided in the mParticle UI as shown in the previous section. For example, based on the previous example, the folder path and name is \nsftp.mparticle.com:4422:drop/us1-123456789123456789/\n. \nHint:\n Verify that there are no trailing spaces in the name.\n\n\nUse your credentials to upload your CSV files to mParticle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s SFTP server, using the correct path and folder name from the previous step.\n\n\n\n\nFiles on the SFTP location are added to the processing queue nearly immediately.  Depending on file count and file size, a backlog may develop. You can observe how much data has been processed using Data Master and your outbound connections. There is no notification of processing progress or completion.\n\n\nCSV File Reference\n provides more information about processing behavior and the advanced techniques of working with custom manifests or encrypted files.\nWas this page helpful?\nYes\nNo\nLast Updated: \nJanuary 23, 2025\n\u00c2\u00a9 2025 mParticle, Inc.

A rule is a script which accepts an incoming mParticle Events API \u00e2\u0080\u009cbatch\u00e2\u0080\u009d object and modifies it according to your business logic. Some example use-cases for a rule are:\n\n\n\n\nModify a batch\u00e2\u0080\u0099s data\n\n\nDrop a batch\n\n\nModify an event\u00e2\u0080\u0099s data\n\n\nDrop an event from a batch\n\n\nAdd events to a batch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRule execution\n\n\nEach of your Inputs, such as for your web, mobile, or server-to-server data, has an individually configured data pipeline, and each Input\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pipeline contains the same key stages. Rules are therefore applied for a specific Input\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pipeline, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s up to you choose where in that Input\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pipeline each Rule is executed. A single Input pipeline may contain multiple Rules each stage. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmParticle pipeline stages\n\n\nStage 1 - Input\n\n\nData is received by mParticle for a specific Input (such as Web, iOS, or a custom server feed).\n\n\nStage 2 - Storage and Processing\n \n\n\nThe Input\u00e2\u0080\u0099s data is stored and processed by mParticle, including:\n\n\n\n\nmParticle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s profile system, which stores user data and enriches the Input\u00e2\u0080\u0099s data based on the existing profile of that user.\n\n\nmParticle Data Master tool\n\n\n\n\nStage 3 - Output\n\n\nThe Input\u00e2\u0080\u0099s data is sent individually to the mParticle Audience system and 300+ partner integrations. In this stage the pipeline actually branches out with a single Input potentially being connected to many Outputs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRule application\n\n\nRules are applied to a specific Input\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pipeline. There are two places in the pipeline where rules can be applied:\n\n\nIn between Stage 1 and Stage 2\n \n\n\nRules executed between Stage 1 and Stage 2 affect the data sent to both Stage 2 and then Stage 3, including the mParticle profile store, audience store, and all outputs. These are labeled \u00e2\u0080\u009cAll Output\u00e2\u0080\u009d Rules in your mParticle dashboard.\n\n\nWarning: If you specify a subtractive rule as All Outputs and apply it between \nstages 1 and 2\n, such as dropping events from a batch, you may remove data that you don't intend to remove and the data may not be recoverable because it's dropped before storage and processing.\n\n\nIn between Stage 2 and Stage 3\n\n\nYou can also apply a rule right before it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sent to a \nspecific\n Output. This lets you mutate data to handle specific requirements or mappings that need to occur for a given partner integration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRule requirements\n\n\n\n\nAll rules accept an mParticle Events API batch object and can return a modified or null batch object.\n\n\nThere are some differences in error handling and available fields depending on pipeline location. See \nRules Developer Guide\n for details.\n\n\nA 200ms timeout applies to all rules. You can choose if a batch should be dropped or continue unprocessed by the rules in the case of a timeout.\n\n\n\n\nRules are executed on the server and only act on data forwarded downstream server-to-server. A warning is shown in the dashboard if you set up one of the following rules: \n\n\n\n\nA rule for integrations that forwards data client-side via a kit.\n\n\nA rule for hybrid integrations that support forwarding via client-side and server-to-server.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are using a rule to modify user identities or user attributes, you must include a \u00e2\u0080\u009cUser Identity Change Event\u00e2\u0080\u009d (\nuser_identity_change\n) or a \u00e2\u0080\u009cUser Attribute Change Event\u00e2\u0080\u009d (\nuser_attribute_change\n). See \nRules Developer Guide\n for an example of \nuser_attribute_change\n in a rule.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a function in AWS\n\n\nmParticle rules are hosted in your AWS account as Lambda functions. To do this, you need to be able to provide an Amazon Resource Number (ARN) for your rule. See the \nAWS Lambda documentation\n for help creating a function.  The Lambda functions used for rules must be hosted in the same AWS region as your \nmParticle account\n.\n\n\n\n\nThe name of the function must begin with \u00e2\u0080\u009cmpr\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nYour development rule must have an alias of \u00e2\u0080\u009c$LATEST\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nYour production rule must have an alias of \u00e2\u0080\u009cPROD\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\n\nYour ARNs should look something like this:\n\n\narn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:999999999999:function:mprmylambdafunction:PROD\n\n\narn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:999999999999:function:mprmylambdafunction:$LATEST\n\n\n\n  When providing an Amazon Resource Number (ARN), you must specify the correct ARN for the localized data center, or pod, for your mParticle organization. Refer to \nData Hosting Locations\n to determine the correct ARN for your pod. If do not know which pod to specify for your organization, contact your account representative.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIAM user\n\n\nTo connect to your AWS Lambda function, you must provide the AWS Access Key ID and Secret Access Key for an \nIAM user\n.\n\n\nIn the IAM dashboard, add the following permissions policy for the user:\n\n\n{\n\n    \n\"Version\"\n:\n \n\"2012-10-17\"\n,\n\n    \n\"Statement\"\n:\n \n[\n\n        \n{\n\n            \n\"Sid\"\n:\n \n\"mpRulesLogs\"\n,\n\n            \n\"Effect\"\n:\n \n\"Allow\"\n,\n\n            \n\"Action\"\n:\n \n[\n\n                \n\"logs:CreateLogGroup\"\n,\n\n                \n\"logs:CreateLogStream\"\n,\n\n                \n\"logs:DescribeLogGroups\"\n,\n\n                \n\"logs:DescribeLogStreams\"\n,\n\n                \n\"logs:FilterLogEvents\"\n,\n\n                \n\"logs:PutLogEvents\"\n\n            \n]\n,\n\n            \n\"Resource\"\n:\n \n[\n\n                \n\"arn:aws:logs:us-east-1:*:log-group:/aws/lambda/mpr*\"\n\n            \n]\n\n        \n}\n,\n\n        \n{\n\n            \n\"Sid\"\n:\n \n\"mpRulesMetrics\"\n,\n\n            \n\"Effect\"\n:\n \n\"Allow\"\n,\n\n            \n\"Action\"\n:\n \n[\n\n                \n\"cloudwatch:GetMetricStatistics\"\n\n            \n]\n,\n\n            \n\"Resource\"\n:\n \n[\n\n                \n\"*\"\n\n            \n]\n\n        \n}\n,\n\n        \n{\n\n            \n\"Sid\"\n:\n \n\"mpRulesLambda\"\n,\n\n            \n\"Effect\"\n:\n \n\"Allow\"\n,\n\n            \n\"Action\"\n:\n \n[\n\n                \n\"lambda:InvokeFunction\"\n,\n\n                \n\"lambda:GetAlias\"\n\n            \n]\n,\n\n            \n\"Resource\"\n:\n \n[\n\n                \n\"arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:*:function:mpr*\"\n\n            \n]\n\n        \n}\n\n    \n]\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIAM role\n\n\nYou will also need to create a role in IAM. Assign this role the same policy document created above.\n\n\n\n\nAssign this role to each Lambda function you plan to deploy as an mParticle rule.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreating a rule in the dashboard\n\n\n\n\nCreate a rule by navigating to \nData Master > Rules\n \n\n\nClick \nNew Rule\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter your Development and Production ARNs and click \nTest\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nError handling\n\n\nWhen you first test a rule, you must select a \nFailure Action\n. This determines what happens if your rule throws an unhandled exception. There is no default action, you must select one of the following:\n\n\n\n\nIf you choose \nDiscard\n, an unhandled exception causes your rule return \nnull\n, effectively dropping the batch.\n\n\nIf you choose \nProceed\n, an unhandled exception causes your rule to return the unaltered batch object, proceeding as if the rule had not been applied.\n\n\n\n\nRegardless of which option you choose, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s best practice to handle all exceptions in your code, rather than falling back on the above defaults. This is especially true if your rule deals with events, where an unhandled exception from just one event could lead to all events in the batch being dropped.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJavascript syntax\n\n\nRule examples and samples use Javascript syntax, but it is possible to use any language supported by AWS Lambda.\n\n\nexports.handler=(batch,context,callback)=>{\n    //do something with batch\n    callback(null, batch)\n}\n\n\nYour code must be a valid \nLambda function\n.\n\n\n\n\nbatch\n is the complete incoming batch object.\n\n\ncontext\n is a required argument for Lambda functions, but is effectively \nnull\n for mParticle rules.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTesting rules\n\n\nThe first time you test a rule, you are asked to provide a name, description and failure action. After naming a rule, you can test it by using one of the sample templates provided in the Test rule dialog. You can also copy and paste batch JSON from your Live Stream. If you do this, be sure to pick a full batch to copy, not a single event.  Click \nTest\n to run. Optionally, check a box to save your JSON template in local storage for future testing.\n\n\nYou must enter valid \nbatch\n JSON in the code editor.  \n\n\nIf there are any syntactical errors in your code, warning or error icons will display next to the line number with details of the problem so you can correct.\n\n\nAfter clicking \nTest\n, you can examine the JSON output from your function to see that the input has been modified as expected.\n\n\nAfter a successful test you can click \nSave\n to save the Rule. Due to recent updates in AWS Lambda, it may be necessary to wait one minute after a successful test in order to save the Rule.\n\n\nIf your test fails, try examining the \nlogs\n for any console output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVersioning\n\n\nWhen you first create a rule, by default it will only be applied to \nDEV\n data. As well as testing a rule with sample JSON you should test the rule in your dev environment to make sure data reaching your output services is as expected. When you are ready to apply a rule to your production data, click \nPromote to Prod\n on the rule page. This will create a \u00e2\u0080\u009cv1\u00e2\u0080\u009d production rule.\n\n\nNote that before a rule can be promoted to Prod, you must remove all \nconsole.log()\n statements.\n\n\nIf you need to make changes, choose \n$LATEST\n from the \nVersion\n dropdown. All other versions are read only. Test your changes with your dev environment and, when you are ready, click \nPromote to Prod\n to create \u00e2\u0080\u009cv2\u00e2\u0080\u009d of your production rule.\n\n\nNote that you can have a maximum of 50 versions per rule. If you have too many versions, select a version and click the trash can icon to the right of the version number to delete it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStatus\n\n\nEach rule has a master switch in the Settings panel. If there is a problem with your rule, you can switch it off and it will be disabled for all connections until you enable it again.
